# Compose
Scale up and down the nodes by using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Install the tooling by following that link.

    docker-compose --version #=> version 1.7.1, build 0a9ab35

## Usage
Either clone this repository or download the files [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) using `wget`

    wget -nv "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elgalu/docker-selenium/master/docker-compose.yml"

### Run
Either start with `docker-compose up` and `scale` later or scale directly and run in daemon mode:

    SELENIUM_HUB_PORT=4444 docker-compose -p selenium scale hub=1 chrome=3 firefox=3

Wait until the grid starts properly before starting the tests _(Optional but recommended)_

    docker exec selenium_firefox_5 wait_all_done 30s

### Cleanup
The `down` compose command stops and remove containers, networks, volumes, and images created by `up` or `scale`

    docker-compose down
